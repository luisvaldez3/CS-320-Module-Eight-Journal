1. How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

After learning so much from this class, I can use unit and integration tests, to make sure that my software is reliable. I would also need to make sure that I have the right testing strategies to meet all the client's requirements. 
I believe that having the ability to create unit tests using code to find errors is an important skill set to have along this CS journey. Testing is a key focus in the SDLC. For security, I can use static code testing to find vulnerabilities early on. In addition, being able to analyze different ways based on the clientâ€™s requirements and executing them is another asset to the toolbelt. I have enjoyed learning throughout this course as the value will take me a long way.


2. How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

Through the SDLC many different moving pieces collectively create an end product. I have learned that using the agile method works well when trying to create software with a team I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program by gathering the client's requirements, and any important data and having meetings with my product owner to make sure I touch on all of the requirements. I like to understand what the user truly needs so, I believe that having as much information would only benefit everyone in the long run. Also, I would make sure to create code that any developer who is working with me can understand and jump right in, due to any type of absence I could potentially have. 
   
3. How do I approach designing software?

First, I gather the information/requirements and prioritize tasks to create my own user stories. This will be the initial step to having use cases that capture functionalities. Next, I would look at the type of method I am looking to follow, which most of the time the best approach is agile because it has flexible adaptations which is perfect for complex projects. The architecture would be next, to figure out how to set up the system's main components and make sure to see how they interact. UI/UX would need to be in line with customer requirements as well. Before product launch, addressing issues early through testing is key to success. JUnit/Static testing are great tools I learned to use to ensure code is efficient. Lastly, receiving feedback from everyone in the SDLC is important because there may be something that someone sees that the other didn't, therefore in a collective effort, this works out for everyone greatly.
